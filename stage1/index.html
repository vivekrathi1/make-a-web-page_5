        	<h2 class="concept-title">Web Basics</h2>
            <p>Internet is the interconnection of networked computers, also known as the web. When we try to access a web page,
            we actually send an <b><em>http</em></b> request to this <b>WEB</b><em>(interconnection of Computers)</em>
            through our <b>Browser</b>, which is connected to a collection of HTML documents on a server, 
            which respond to our request and a page is rendered in our browser in the form of<b>content</b><em>(videos,docs,images).</em>

    	<h2 class="concept-title">HTML Basics</h2>
        <p>HTML -Hyper text mark up language is nothing but the language, a language that contains the following:-</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Text</li>
        	<li>Markup<em>(the way the page is displayed)</em></li>
        	<li>References to Other Content::<em>(<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">Links to other webpages</a>, 
        		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTTpkEqCico">Videos</a> and

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
    	<h2 class="concept-title">Tags/Attributes:</h2>
        <p>The language mainly consists of the following.</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Tags:-define the layout of the content inside the page</li>
        		<li>Attributes:-refers to additional information regarding the contents</li>

		<h2 class="concept-title">Basics of HTML and CSS</h2>
		<p>HTML and CSS are both languages.<br>
			<b><u>Definitions</u></b><br>
			<b>HTML</b> controls the structure of the web page, like the structure of a house, which room is kitchen, bedroom,living room. etc.<br>
			<b>CSS</b> on the oher hand defines the style of a webpage, color of the walls and how things look in the house is something that would be done by <b>CSS</b> in a webpage.<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept">
		<h2 class="concept-title">HTML,What it consists of actually</h2>
		<p>
			<b>HTML</b> consists of syntax and rules and the basic word in the language is a tag. Browser knows how to interpret HTML tags into elements of a tree like structure using a convention known as DOM(Document Object Model).<br>
			<b>Tags</b> contain content, other tags or content and so on in a nested way. Each <b>Tag </b> defines the type of element inside of it.<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept">
		<h2 class="concept-title">CSS</h2>
		<p>
			CSS defines the style of the page, also has certain syntax and rules to change the way elements look on the page, the size of the font, color, background, borders, positions etc. In the exercise involving the developer tools we turned circles into squares by unchecking the border-radius attribute.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept">
		<h2 class="concept-title">"Boxify" the Design</h2>
		<p>
			We also learnt about breaking down the webpage into pieces and how everything on a webpage is a box no matter what shape it might seem on the page.

	<h1 class="lesson" >Lesson 3: Applying Style to the page via CSS</h1>
	<div class="concept">
	    <h2 class="concept-title">Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
	    <p>
	    	Each element on the HTML can have a class attribute and Style can be applied using two ways<br>
	    </p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Using The tag in the HTML.</li>
	    		<li>Using the selector i.e. attributes to the tag, the class.<br></li>
	    	</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="concept">
		<h2 class="concept-title">Inheritance:Concept of Re-usability</h2>
		<p>
			CSS Styles is inherited from parent classes to child classes.<br>
			Child classes retain their style and override anything in the parent classes.<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept">
		<h2 class="concept-title"> Avoiding Repetition</h2>
		<p>
			In the CSS style sheet we can <b>"group"</b> elements having <b>"common"</b> style and give them style by grouping the common element,<br>
            Instead of repeating the same style for each element time and again. <br>
            Re-usability lets us re use the styles we have already defined and apply more styles as we put more content in the page.<br>
            It is advantageous, as we don't have to add style for each new element that we add.
            For e.g. I have defined a style for all <b>concept-titles</b> in my page in the CSS, If I add new concept-title as my page grows, I don't have to put a separate style for that, the style for class concept-title automatically gets applied to it.
		</p>

	<div class="concept">
		<h2 class="concept-title">Basics of Margins/Borders/Padding/Content</h2>
		<p>
			CSS uses margins/border/padding to keep the content distinct
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Margins- Outer most container.</li>
				<li>Border-container around the content.</li>
				<li>Padding- Clears the area around the content. </li>
				<li>Content- Image/Text. </li>
			</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="concept">
		<h2 class="concept-title">Alignment Tricks</h2>
		<p>
			Border-box and flex box are the two approaches discussed in the lecture.<br>
			<u>Flexible Box</u> is an efficient way to align items and distribute the space among items in a container or div.<br>
